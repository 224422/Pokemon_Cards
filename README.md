AP Computer Science Final Project

# Author Bio
My name is Akshay V and i am a Junior at Shakopee High School. This year I decided to take AP CSP and see if I was interested in following the computer science career path. I am happy to say that I really enjoyed the course and that computer science may be a probable option for my future.
 
# Website Description
With the huge amount of cards on the market it is easy to get your collection mixed up. That is why this Website is made to help you organize your Pokemon Cards! The website was made using the Cloud9 templates. The website was made using primarily code from Google. The development of this website included a lot of trial and error with me running each part of the program every step of the way. It was made as a final project for the course.

# File Types
PHP, HTML (Echoed in the PHP), and JavaScript.

# How to Use
  Enter all the relevant fields for your pokemon cards.
  Then hit 'Add' to add the entry to a table.
  Hit 'Delete' to delete an existing entry with the same fields.
  Hit 'Edit' to change an existing entry based on the Name that you type in.
  Hit 'Details' (No user entry necessary) to show a list of all the information in the table.
  The 'Dismiss' button dismisses all the notifications/user feedback that the site gives.
